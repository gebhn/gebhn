<h1><strong>On Simplicity</strong> - 2025-06-07</h1>
________________________________________________________________________________

As a second-career software engineer, I started coding at a time when complexity
was often seen as a virtue, and "bigger is better" was the prevailing mindset.
Over the years, I've seen and, admittedly, written many overly complicated
solutions to problems that shouldn't have been so difficult in the first place.

My journey began with JavaScript, a language that, while powerful, often
presents an array of over-engineered solutions. It's easy to get caught in the
cycle of chasing "The New Thing" instead of refining what's already there.

There's a common saying that when your only tool is a hammer, every problem
looks like a nail. With JavaScript, especially in front-end development, you
might go looking for a nail only to discover you need a whole toolkit: special
gloves, a nail expert to identify the nail, another expert to tell you what the
hammered nail should look like, and then you find your hammer handle has been
deprecated in favor of a nail gun.

Early in my professional career, I quickly learned that many solutions introduce
a new set of unique problems. Often, you're forced to buy into an entire
ecosystem upfront, with no guarantee it'll be sustainable in the long run.
This isn't a new issue, nor is it exclusive to JavaScript or even software
development. However, I believe there's room for me to improve.

Entranced by the prospect of career advancement through the latest frameworks,
I plunged into the ever-expanding and often confusing landscape of NPM. When it
came time to build my own portfolio website, I opted for Gatsby, believing it
was the right choice. I wrote thousands of lines of JavaScript to parse blog
posts, generate static pages, and implement styling libraries and reusable
components. I truly thought I was doing everything by the book. The result was
a beautiful, albeit jumbled, mix of React components and Markdown blog posts.
I eagerly bought a domain and fumbled with Netlify to deploy it immediately.

I was ecstatic. It was magnificent. I refreshed the browser, checked all the
accessibility scores and Lighthouse tests, and admired my work. Then I landed
my first job, and my portfolio site sat untouched for over a year.

Whoops.

One weekend, a domain renewal reminder prompted me to update my portfolio and
showcase my new skills. I cloned the repository, ran the install script to
update dependencies, and immediately realized my grave error.

Gatsby no longer worked. My formatters and linters were outdated, the plugin I
used for generating slugs had major breaking changes, and the page generation
API was completely different. My site wouldn't build.

I consulted the documentation, reading through all the changes. In just twelve
months, so much had changed, and I had used so few of Gatsby's features that I
realized a simple static site generator and a classless CSS library could
replicate my site's functionality.

I cleaned up the repository, deleting 90% of the code. I replaced it with a few
HTML templates and a Makefile to run the Zola command-line tool to build the
website. It was faster to build, quicker to deploy, easier to develop, and far
simpler to understand.

________________________________________________________________________________

Could I have just left my dependencies outdated and ignored the security
vulnerability warnings from NPM? Probably. It wouldn't have felt good, but I
could have deployed the site.

Recently, I decided to rewrite my personal website again. Mostly because I
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony" target="_blank">don't do any blogging</a>, a full-blown static site generator was overkill. This
time, I chose to use pure HTML. No external processes, no build commands,
no dependencies.

Since then, I've adopted Go as my primary language and dabbled in a few others.
There are countless blog posts from countless smart people who can tell you why
one language is superior for their use case or why certain features make a
language worth using above all others. But for me, it all boils down to one
thing: simplicity.

I appreciate that there's generally only one way to write idiomatic Go code.
The language has just 25 keywords, including built-in concurrency mechanisms.
The formatter prevents arguments about tabs versus spaces, there are no ternary
expressions, and even the while keyword has been removed from loop syntax. It's
painstakingly imperative and strips away any <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shoot_oneself_in_the_foot" target="_blank">desire to be clever</a>.

I like that the language doesn't break, and that the ecosystem encourages a
"roll-your-own" approach to library design that integrates with the standard
libraries rather than circumventing them.

I like that if you search for "go websocket library," you'll likely find the
same gorilla/websocket project that has been around for ten years, and if you
check <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/websocket#pkg-overview" target="_blank">the official documentation</a>, you'll find the same package.

In twelve months, when I decide to update my website, I know the only thing
waiting for me will be an HTML document. In twelve years, this same HTML
document will almost certainly still work exactly as it does today, and I'll
probably still be using gorilla/websocket.

In my early days, I mistakenly equated learning new tools with improving my
craft. While there's certainly value in trying new things, it's not the only
path to growth.

Thanks for reading.
